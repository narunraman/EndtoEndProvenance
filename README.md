# EndtoEndProvenance

### Purpose
As part of work done at UBC, we wanted to give scientists and people interested in data provenance a way to collect provenance in a language-agnostic and -fluid setting.
More information on data provenance and previous work can be found [here](https://github.com/End-to-end-provenance/End-to-end-provenance.github.io/blob/master/README.md).

This repo serves as an example for an end-to-end functionality using Camflow. 
One can view the example using any script on any language. This was tested, and shown viability via the [hurrecon model](https://github.com/margoseltzer/hurrecon) in Python and R.
Built on two languages (Python and R) we can view a provenance graph for the same scripts in both languages using camflow.

## HowTo
To view this example, you will need language and system-level provenance collection tools.
The installation guide can be found in this repo in the prov_setup markdown file. 
End to end collection through camflow can be found in the Camflow folder, wherein a README will guide you further.
